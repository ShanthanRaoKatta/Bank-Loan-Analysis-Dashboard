Project Title:
Bank Loan Analytics Dashboard

Headline:
A comprehensive Power BI dashboard for monitoring loan portfolio health, borrower behavior, and lending performance through interactive KPIs and visual insights.

Summary & Purpose:
The Loan Performance Analytics Dashboard is built to give financial and analytics teams a clear, real-time view of their loan portfolio’s health. 
It combines operational insights (like total applications, repayments, and default trends) with financial intelligence (like interest rates, DTI ratios, and funding 
performance). This dashboard bridges the gap between raw data and decision-making. It helps analysts identify early risk indicators, spot profitable borrower segments, 
and optimize lending strategies. With interactive visuals and automated MTD/MoM metrics, users can quickly pinpoint which loan categories, regions, or borrower types are
driving growth — and which need attention.Ultimately, it transforms static reports into a living analytics tool that supports smarter credit decisions, better portfolio 
monitoring, and continuous business improvement.
